# PPC-Web-Based-Calculator
Web based programming centric calculator.  Can easily be incorporated into web projects via an iframe.

I needed a calculator on a project I was doing.  I found a calculator on-line that allowed me to add it into the project.  However, once the project was done I became annoyed with the tracking and adds that is brought onto my page.  So, I set out to build my own.  I also added a bunch of conversions, to my knowledge this is the only section that is not completely finished.  Although it does base conversions it does not do math other than base 10. 

 

The four files are: 

calc.html                             = is the actual calculator, also this is the page you would point an iframe to 

calc.css                              = the styling 

calc.js                               = the actual math is done in here. 

index.html                            = example hot to incorporate the calc.html into a web page 

 

 

In the future I'd like to finish the conversion section and stop the use of jquery.
